<a name="ccsguide"></a><h1 align="center" style="color: black;">CCS GUIDELINES</h1>
<a name="OEA"></a><h2 style="color: black;">               I. ON EXCUSED ABSENCES</h2><h3 style="color: black; font-size: 16px;">                     An absence is only considered excused when supported by valid documents. Below are the possible reasons and the corresponding 
                guidelines to be satisfied before an absence can be considered valid.
            
                       1. When a student gets sick, the following should be presented:
                           
                        • An excuse letter duly signed by the parents or guardian; 
                        • A medical certificate issued by the University doctor to support the excuse.

                     Medical certificates not coming from the University doctor is unacceptable, except those coming from specialists. 
                (e.g. for eye problems, the certificate must come from an EENT specialist)

                       2. If the illness is minor and a medical certificate is not possible, the Guidance Counselor/Facilitator is 
                       given the task to determine the validity of the absence.

                       3. When a student leaves for home to attend some personal/ important matters, the student must secure an excuse 
                       letter signed by the parents/guardian and the Guidance Counselor stating the reason(s);

                            <b style="color: rgb(234, 97, 113);">Note: </b> Documents referred to in #1-#3 of this section must be presented to the
                        faculty concerned signed by the Guidance Counselor/Facilitator within the week the student returns to school, otherwise the 
                        absence automatically becomes unexcused.

                       4. When a student is sent to represent the University, he/she should:
                        
                        • secure in advance the excuse letter signed by the person in charge of the said event;
                        • present the excuse letter signed by the Guidance Counselor/Facilitator to the faculty concerned before leaving the University.
                       
                       5. When a student is required to appear before a public or private office, the student must:

                        • secure an excuse letter signed by the parents/guardian and the Guidance Counselor/Facilitator stating the reason;
                        • submit supporting document/s from the office that requires his/her presence;
                        • present the excuse letter to the faculty concerned before his/her scheduled appearance in the said office
                    
                       6. Students who may have mental or physical health issues must secure a psychiatric or health report from their 
                       psychiatrist or medical doctor. Those who have special cases/issues/ concerns that are highly confidential must secure 
                       a note from the Guidance Counselor.

<a name="OMUE"></a><h2 style="color: black;">               II. ON MAKE-UP EXAMINATIONS</h2><h3 style="color: black; font-size: 16px;">                     1. It is the student's responsibility to take the initiative in approaching the faculty in taking make-up examinations.  

                     2. A student will only be allowed to take make-up examinations for major exams (e.g. prelim, midterm and final) provided 
                     that the absence is excused (see section on excused absences for guidelines).

                     3. Make-up exams for quizzes, long examinations, hands-on exams and hands-on exercises are faculty's prerogative. 

                     4. If the date of the examination is the same as the date a student is advised by a physician to return to class, the student 
                     may opt to postpone taking the exam.
                     
                     5. It is the faculty's discretion to set the make-up examination schedule.
                     
                     <a name="OA"></a><h2 style="color: black;">               III. ON ATTENDANCE</h2><h3 style="color: black; font-size: 16px;">                     1. Three (3) unexcused late arrivals (15 minutes after the scheduled time a course begins) is equivalent to 1 unexcused absence.

                     2. Three (3) consecutive unexcused absences will mean automatic dropping of the student from the class and a grade of "F".

                     3. Only three (3) unexcused and seven (7) excused absences are allowed for the entire semester. Penalty is the same as in #2
