In November 1988, the Silliman University Computer Center (SUCC) was established with the objective of centralizing computer degree 
offerings of the University. Engr. Alfredo T. Ang was the appointed head of this unit. Originally, the center serviced the computer 
non-IT degrees as well as short courses. These short courses were open to all interested members of the community. In 1992, services 
were expanded to include the computer degree (Bachelor of Science in Business Computer Application), a degree offering of the 
College of Business Administration (CBA).
   
In June 1994, the Computer Center moved to the newly completed Uytengsu Foundation Computer Center Building, which was later 
renamed Uytengsu Foundation Computer Center (UFCC).
   
In 1999, the UFCC's services were further expanded to include the second computer degree offering of CBA, Bachelor of Science 
in Information Technology.
   
In line with the Commission on Higher Education's thrust to control the number of Information Technology Education degrees 
and to centralize its offering within the institution, Silliman University created the College of Information Technology and 
Computer Sciences. The College became fully operational in June 2001, with Engr. Ang as its Acting Dean.
   
The first degree offerings were the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) and Bachelor of Science in 
Computer Science (BSCS). In the following year, the College offered the Bachelor of Science in Information Management 
(BSIM), now known as the Bachelor of Science in Information Systems (BSIS) program.
